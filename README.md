# Landmarkers

Welcome to Landmarkers!


### Main Objective

This web App's main goal is to have a record of all the landmarks (disney's world, Eiffel Tower ..etc..) user's have been. Users are able to leave 'comment'-like type of content on each logs.


Various technologies will be used this web application; Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS(SASS), along with a built API by yours truly! (wunderlust-API). The API was built with Express.js Node.js and deployed on heroku.

### API Repo and Deployment

API Repo
https://github.com/teejaymoo/wunderlust-API

API deployment
https://wunderlust-api-626.herokuapp.com/

This API will communicate with my database which stores all users and landmarks.
wunderlust-API itself will use express.js to CRUD all of the landmarks and the users
into the database.


## Design details:
This will be a SPA (single page application), it will contain a sign-up/login fornt page along with the main page that will display all logs made. The main page will also have a section to create a new log. Each log will have a feature of updating and deleting the logs.

## Unsolved problems

Not so much as unsolved, more of out of scope and dreaming high.
I would eventually implement the ability to use images.
I would also eventually implement the ability to scout other users logs and comments.



## Web engine

Implementing Javascript, jQuery/AJAX CRUD.

## User Stories
-As a user, I want be able to sign-up.
-As a user, I want log in.
-As a user, I want have the ability to change my password.
-As a user, I want be able to sign-out
-As a user, I want be able to create a record of places.
-As a user, I want click on my profile and see all of the logs I've made
-As a user, I want to be able to update any of the logs I've made.
